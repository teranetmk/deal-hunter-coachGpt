Once we are done with these points I will update the server and add the ssh. Also if there is nothing else I will send the offer today and upload these changes to the server.



1. Can remove the time part from date added to list - DONE
2. After you click upload list on popup it still does not close down the popup after success - DONE
3. Change the bottom hover overlay for pagination be red color instead of blue - Done for both lists and dashboard pages
4. Add Email and Phone Number - Done - column names are OWNER PHONE NUMBER and OWNER EMAIL ADDRESS
5. also change the all capitalized - changed all column names to uppercase
6. Add Property City, State , etc - Done
7. The bottom cells still have the header labels inside of them can’t have that - Removed.
8. When click download list just have it download everything not just what checkbox — be making more changes to checkbox in next scope I just want to have there now but no actions yet - Done
9. New login screen sub headline under log in - Sign into your account to access DealHunter - Done

Changed downloaded fileName to DealHunterProperties.csv. Let me know if you want something else.



1. Remove time from date added to list cell -- just remove the 00:00:00 - keep the date 
 - done
2. Remove the success messages -- yes the close down of the popup is enough don't need the success messages
 - done
3. Remove the double email 2 and phone 2 number duplicate columns from file template download sheet -- yes just remove the email 2 and phone number 2 from the file template since will just use one for each not 2
 - Done
4. I can click and pick up and drag the popups around please remove that ability -- yes this could cause issues just make it fixed like all other popups on websites 
 - done
5. Upload List popup — needs to be big bold headline font — on the Upload list popup after clicking upload list button -- if you go to upload list on lists page for some reason the headline text in upper left hand corner is like small subheadline text instead of the normal bold headlines for other popups 
 - done
6. Move sorting icon for degrees of motivation back next to headline with normal distance like on the lists page -- yes looked like the filtering moved should be same as the lists page 
 - increased min size of col to ensure header does not wrap and hence display the way you wanted 
7. IMPORTANT: When You Click Add Tag Popup Use The Scroll And Search Bar To Find Tags Where They Can Click And Add -- Yes so just have basically same thing as the add tags to list popup but have the (37) number in each like you did on the current popup next to the motivation tags available
   Here is the sketch showing exactly what i mean replacing the add tags popup on dashboard screen: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f0G6_XlPQzcJrSQAWhJt_NNgNfwcmg42fRLZYkI0ezA/edit?usp=sharing
 - Done
8. When click into field on login/signup/forgot password its blue color it should be like black -- yes looks like when click into the fields the outer lines turn blue instead of black - Done
 - Done
